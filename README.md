# C Code Scanner

This repository holds a C program scanner that reports lexical, syntactic and semantic errors.
It was built using `flex` and `bison` as tools to generate a lexical analyzers and parsers, respectively.
On top of that, logic was applied to report semantic errors such as double declarations.

## Reports

The program returns a report of the `variables defined`, `functions defined with params`, `type of sentence`, `semantic errors`, `unknown lines`.

## Project

This will be the starting point of a new project where a basic compiler for a new programming language will be created.
